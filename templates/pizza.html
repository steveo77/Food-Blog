          <p><br><b>-The Backspace:</b>  Owner and chef Shawn Cirkielâ€™s opened The Backspace right behind his successful restaurant Parkside. The Backspace is a Neapolitan-style pizzeria. The pizza has a light crisp crust, fresh mozzarella, locally sourced toppings and is drizzled with olive oil. Backspace has a full menu and is not exclusive to pizza, all the food that I have had has been excelent. This is a small restaurant, so seating is limited. </b>

          <p><br><b>-Home Slice:</b>  Home Slice Pizza was created by Jen and Joseph Strickland and there partner Terri Hannifin back in 2004. It is a New York style pizza, large slices with a crispy crust, generous amounts of cheese and fresh toppings. It is located on South Congress in the trendy South Austin area. They have two locations right next to each other, one for dine in and one for take out. Because of its popularity I would suggest calling ahead. </b>

This is a classic big slice of pizza 30' inch for the large or 20' inch.  They also sell pizza by the slice. They are not trying to be fancy, great pizza for a fair price.
